Real Estate Profitability Tool


DESCRIPTION
This project introduces an interactive real estate profitability tool, designed to empower both novice and expert real estate investors to make informed decisions in the competitive U.S. housing market.


Our tool features two intuitive dashboards:


1. Opportunity Scorecard
    - A city/state-level map color-coded by investment metrics, such as Cash Flow, GRM, Cap Rate, and Cash-on-Cash Return.
    - Users can select desired metrics to display on the map or input investment details (e.g., property price, down payment, interest rate, mortgage term) to view personalized investment calculations.


2. Opportunity Explorer
    - A zip-code/MSA-level map and calculator for detailed analysis.
    - Users can refine results by inputting location data (state, city, zip code) and explore demographic and financial data for selected areas.
    - Displays investment metrics, expenses, profitability calculations, and future trend projections, benchmarking results against industry standards.


Built using Tableau, the tool offers dynamic, user-friendly visualizations.
